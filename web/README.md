## DizzyPrice Web Frontend

This front-end for the dizzyprice Price-ID tool remains unreleased, despite
appearing on this repo. If you want to deploy this, please see the constants
at the top of `dizzyprice.php` to set where you place the python scripts
(dizzyprice.py and objects.py). You may also want to modify the text at the
bottom of the file to fit your needs.

For the purposes of this distribution, the dizzyprice front-end is released
under the AGPLv3+.
